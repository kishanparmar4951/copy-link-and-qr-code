This folder is reserved for the open-source qrcode-generator JavaScript library by Kazuhiko Arase.

To comply with WordPress.org guidelines you should bundle the UNMINIFIED source here before publishing:

1. Download the unminified file `qrcode.js` from:
   https://github.com/kazuhikoarase/qrcode-generator/tree/master/js

2. Place the file in this folder as:
   libraries/qrcode-generator/qrcode.js

3. Optionally include qrcode.min.js for production:
   libraries/qrcode-generator/qrcode.min.js

4. Include the MIT license file or ensure THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md contains the correct license text.

If you can't bundle the file, provide clear documentation and use an opt-in CDN fallback, but bundling the unminified source is preferred for WordPress.org review.
